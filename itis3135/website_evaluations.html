		<h2>Website Evaluations With CRAP Principles</h2>
		
        <section>
            <h3 style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Site 1: Target <a href="https://www.target.com" style="font-size: 25px;"> Target.com</a></h3>


            <p>Online store that provides info on locations, products, and services.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast - Easy to look at visually, has a decent colour scheme that doesn't make the bright red of the Target ball seem too hard on the eyes.
                    
                </li>
                <li>Repetition - There is repetition in the font style, but not much else on the rest of the page. There is a repetition in the colour scheme but that is what keeps it seem orderly.
                </li>
                <li>Alignment - All text that should be on the same line is on the same line. Non of the margins are skewed, and everythin looks neat and in order.
                </li>
                <li>Proximity - Some of the images that are contrasting seem like they are quite close together, but it is aligned in a way that does not make it seem overly crowded. </li>
            </ul>


        </section>

        <section>
            <h3 style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Site 2: Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com" style="font-size: 25px;"> Amazon.com</a></h3>
            
                <p>An online store that provides delivery of all kinds of products, local, individual, and company-based vendors alike.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast - This site has a lot more contrast than target in my opinion, some of the colour clashes and it is not the nicest to look at.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repetition - There is little to no repetition on this page. There is a lot going on, and nowhere on any of the elements are items repeated or emphasized, which makes some things hard to find.
                    </li>
                    <li>Alignment - The products are all aligned in a nice orderly fashion, but it is sometimes all over the place depending on where you are in the site.
                    </li>
                    <li>Proximity - There is extreme prximity for everythign on this site. Most images and text are extremely close together, which does not make it the most pleasant visual experience.
                    </li>
                </ul>
