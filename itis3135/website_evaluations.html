		<h2>Website Evaluations With CRAP Principles</h2>
		
        <section>
            <h3 style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Site 1: Target</h3>

            
            <a href="https://www.target.com" style="font-size: 25px;"> Target.com</a>
            <p>Online store that provides info on locations, products, and services.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast - Easy to look at visually, has a decent colour scheme that doesn't make the bright red of the Target ball seem too hard on the eyes.
                    
                </li>
                <li>Repetition - There is repetition in the font style, but not much else on the rest of the page. There is a repetition in the colour scheme but that is what keeps it seem orderly.
                </li>
                <li>Alignment - All text that should be on the same line is on the same line. Non of the margins are skewed, and everythin looks neat and in order.
                </li>
                <li>Proximity - Some of the images that are contrasting seem like they are quite close together, but it is aligned in a way that does not make it seem overly crowded. </li>
            </ul>


        </section>

        <section>
            <h3 style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Site 2: Amazon</h3>
            
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com" style="font-size: 25px;"> Amazon.com</a>
                <p>An online store that provides delivery of all kinds of products, local, individual, and company-based vendors alike.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast - This site has a lot more contrast than target in my opinion, some of the colour clashes and it is not the nicest to look at.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repetition - To say that theres even a crumb of repetition on this site is akin to saying that the sky is purple, or that birds are not real, or even that we all live on a donut shaped pyramid. 
                        The colors of the font in this site is all over the place. Theres not even any similar font-sizes or at least if there is it is mixed up in the sea or random colored and sized fonts as to not allow 
                        you to notice it.
                    </li>
                    <li>Alignment - The alignment of this page is horrendous, there are random boxes all over the place and just when you think that there would be any sembelance of alignment it is broken up by some random boxes for 
                        other products. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Proximity - the proximity for this site is pretty bad. Everything is very close together without any room to show that any single item is not related to another one. Things are strewn around haphazardly
                        and it really makes you wonder how this even happened.
                    </li>
                </ul>
